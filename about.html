				<p>Willatendo (they/them) is an 18-year-old nehiyaw(Cree)-Canadian who has made Minecraft mods for around seven years. Their real name is William, they natively speak English, speak somewhat converstational French, and are learning nehiyawewin(Cree). They attend University in their home province of Alberta, spend a lot of their free time coding, playing video games, writing, baking, and reading.</p>
				<p>Since a very young age, they were entranced by Minecraft, dinosaurs, space, history, language, and much more. They loved watching Megneous, Poet Plays (where their online alias comes from!), Fabe (Ironstonemine), DanTDM, PopularMMOs. Since ~2018, they mostly watch IBXtoycat, Mumbo Jumbo, and Grian, with some Xisumavoid mixed in there!</p>
				<p>Inspired by the Fossils and Archaeology mod and Jurassicraft, in 2020, they created the first version of their first mod: Ancient Creatures. This project soon ebed and flowed into the Lost Worlds, which they had originally planned as an epic-style mod: going from time era to time era until defeating the sinister Time Lord! In 2022, they abandoned the project for a final time due to metal health concerns.</p>
				<p>In 2024, they exploded back on the scene with their most famous mod: Fossils and Archaeology: Legacy. A recreation of the original mod, patched up and made for the then latest version, 1.20.4. It has since evolved into a fork of the original mod!</p>
				<p>You can contact them at their mod-email lostworldsminecraftmod@gmail.com, or through their discord (They are much more likely to respond there!).</p>
