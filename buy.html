				<p>Willatendo offers their services to you. They can make a mod for any version for any modloader. Contact them on discord (username is willatendo) to discuss. Below, you will find the general price of their services. If they do not believe they can make the mod, they will refuse as they want your mod to succeed. They will ask for credit for making the mod and ask that you provide any assets nessisary. They ask for a $25.00 comission upfront and the full price to be payed in full before any jars or code is handed over. Updating versions and bugs are free + hourly wage to update them.</p>

				<p>* Includes any other code required to make it work (eg furnace needs a block, block-entity, menu)<br>** Does not include blocks required for worlgen, "large" pieces like dimensions get $0.10/small-piece like biomes; but a biome would not then include the features unless a biome is made without a dimension.</p>
